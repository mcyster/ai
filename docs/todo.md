# Next

- support ticket classifier 
- validate Extole campaign, page to leverage
- graphbuilder support client_id
- jira endpoint to get data
- web developer, archive, edit creates copy if managed, ...
- ---
- support ticket classifier iteration

# Minor Changes

- remove code store, use VectorStore tool, remove store project
  - load vstore lazily, load old version, then update in background
- prehandler use SearchTool
- cleanup vectorstores, files

# Major Changes

## repos

Make libraries
- Split out Extole, have extole reference via libraries
- 


## Web Weave

- have a git repo per page
  - commit would use comment generated by ai
- support archive
- allow ai to do all operations, copy, save as, ...
- don't allow managed pages to be edited, change pattern to copy then edit

## Extole Weave

- expose report api
- create page endpoint to create an initial listing page to develop from
- scenario to read a ticket


## Cyster Weave

- move session store to weave-rest

## Jira App

Rename jira-app extole-app
- remove extole functionality from weave-app

From ticket expose
- support comment to self, to re-evaluate in future (or do in another service)

Expose a flunet jira enpodoints
-  return a fluent ticket description with markdown for content and well named attributes (currently only done in the tool)

## AI Weave Concepts

Generify Scenarion Result
  - support the concept of a typed response from chat
     - leverage the json response of chat
     - 
Do we need, both
- Scenario
  - Describes an api and context for having a Conversation
  - Use by the rest api to describe the questions it can answer and the context that needs to be provided
- Tool
  - Describe an api for asking a question (One response not a Conversation like a Scenaio)
  - Currently have a decorator to turn a scenario into a Tool

ScenarioSet doesn't really need to exist, just conveninent for Spring integration
- perhaps richer concept holds Context
  - Context-> select scenario set, generalize endpoints
  
Log level
  - should include all aspects of conversation.
  - If nested conversations, it should be possible to navigate and see them.  To properly support this, feel I might need to move to an event based architecture.
  - tbd how to expose in api so that conversations can nest

## Weave++ Concepts

- Schedule in external service
- 

## Conversation

- Support an ascynronous api
- Support rich conversation logs
- Seperate memory from logs

## Deployment / systemd

- Commit basic deployment scripts
- Update scripts to work with systemd or perhaps goto Lamdbas?
- Leverage secret store for keys

# Modules

Use java modules to declare public classes etc rather than separate builds
