# Major Changes

## 3 Concepts necessary?

Do we need 3 concepts
- Scenario
  - Describes an api and context for having a Conversation
  - Use by the rest api to describe the questions it can answer and the context that needs to be provided
- Tool
  - Describe an api for asking a question (One response not a Conversation like a Scenaio)
- Agent
  - Perhaps should be named Assistant (as it sits directly on Assistant)

## Rest API

Need to update to support richer understanding of conversation for prompt development

Response should include all aspects of conversation. If nested conversations, it should be possible to navigate and see them. 
To properly support this, feel I might need to move to an event based architecture.

## Conversation

- Support an ascynronous api
- Support rich conversation logs
- Seperate memory from logs

## Documentation

Mechanism to crawl / upload documentation

QDRant

### Public Code

Upload code directly from github

## Deployment / systemd

Commit basic deployment scripts

Update scripts to work with systemd or perhaps goto Lamdbas?

Leverage secret store for keys


# Modules

Use modules to declare public classes etc rather than separate builds
