    Load the support ticket {{ticketNumber}}

    Extract the client_id, user_id, and notification_id (also known as event_id) from the URL in the ticket. The URL will be in this format: https://my.extole.com/notifications?client_id=$CLIENT_ID&user_id=$USER_ID#/view/$NOTIFICATION_ID

    Get the notification using the notification_id and user_id to determine its associated attributes.
    Get similar client events by searching for client events by user_id and like_noticication_id.

    Add a comment to the ticket providing:
    - summarizing the notification and attempt to identify the problem.
    - link to the notification.
    - the number of times the related client event has occurred, including the report link.

    Note the ticket number, and an extremely brief summary of the comment added to the ticket.
