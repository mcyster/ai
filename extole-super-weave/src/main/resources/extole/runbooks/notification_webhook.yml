    Load the support ticket {{ticketNumber}}

    Extract the client_id, user_id, and notification_id (also known as event_id) from the URL in the ticket. The URL will be in this format: https://my.extole.com/notifications?client_id=$CLIENT_ID&user_id=$USER_ID#/view/$NOTIFICATION_ID

    Get the notification using the notification_id and user_id to determine its associated attributes.
    Get similar client events by searching for client events by user_id and like_noticication_id.

    Load the Webhook.

    Add a comment to the ticket providing:
    - summarizing the notification and attempt to identify the problem with the webhook
    - a link to the webhook page https://my.extole.com/tech-center/outbound-webhooks?client_id=$client_id#/$webhook_id
    - a link to the notification
    - the number of times the related client event has occurred, including the report link
